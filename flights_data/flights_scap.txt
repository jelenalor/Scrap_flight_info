Challenges:

Data integrity:
followed tutorial on scrapping data:
list of items and then compile, but not correct order for the case when information is missing
instead have to compile in dictionary to ensure the order of samples are preserved

-> non stop- > stopover information was not correct, less items than other sample, so last X were N/A


2. How to ensure item is one by one listed in selenium

3. Time sleep - not to be blocked


This data looks at the flights for next day and return in a week for a period of the whole week


Other ideas:
Monitor the same flights departing in 6 months - 4 times a day (180 per day for 180 days - 32400 data points)
